\section{Introduction}
The integration of statistical analysis in real estate valuation and wine quality assessment has become increasingly important in modern decision-making processes \cite{cortez2009modeling}. This study analyzes three distinct datasets: real estate pricing data and quality measurements for both red and white wines. The primary objective is to identify significant correlations and predictive relationships that can inform pricing strategies and quality assessment methods.

Our analysis employs various statistical methods including correlation analysis, linear regression, and multiple regression to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on target variables. The implementation utilizes Python's data science ecosystem, particularly pandas for data manipulation and statsmodels for statistical analysis \cite{mckinney2012python}.
