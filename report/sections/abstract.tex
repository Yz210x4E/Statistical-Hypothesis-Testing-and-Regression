\begin{abstract}
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of three distinct datasets: real estate pricing data and quality measurements for both red and white wines. Using Python-based statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we investigate the relationships between various features and their target variables. The analysis employs correlation analysis, linear regression, and multiple regression methods to identify significant patterns and predictive relationships. Our findings reveal important correlations between house prices and location-based features, as well as between wine chemical properties and quality ratings. The results provide valuable insights for real estate valuation and wine quality assessment methodologies.
