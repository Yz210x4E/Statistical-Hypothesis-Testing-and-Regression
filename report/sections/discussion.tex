\section{Discussion}
The analysis reveals several key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item House prices show strong correlation with proximity to transit stations
    \item Wine quality is significantly influenced by alcohol content and acidity
    \item Different chemical properties affect red and white wine quality differently
\end{itemize}

These findings align with previous research in both domains \cite{sklearn_api}, while providing new insights into feature importance and prediction accuracy.
