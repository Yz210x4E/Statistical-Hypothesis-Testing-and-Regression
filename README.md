Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Regression Analysis Dashboard
Epoka University Logo

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that performs statistical hypothesis testing and regression analysis on three datasets: Real Estate Pricing, Red Wine Quality, and White Wine Quality. The app provides interactive visualizations, correlation matrices, and regression analysis to help users explore and understand the relationships within the data.

ðŸ”— Live App: Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Regression Analysis Dashboard

Features
1. Real Estate Pricing Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Visualize the correlation between features in the real estate dataset.

Regression Analysis: Perform linear regression to analyze the relationship between house prices and selected features (e.g., house age, distance to MRT station, number of convenience stores).

Interactive Plots: Scatter plots with regression lines to visualize the relationship between features and house prices.

2. Red and White Wine Quality Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Explore the correlation between features in the red and white wine datasets.

Regression Analysis: Perform linear regression to analyze the relationship between wine quality and selected features (e.g., alcohol content, acidity, pH).

Interactive Plots: Scatter plots with regression lines to visualize the relationship between features and wine quality.

3. User-Friendly Interface
Sidebar Navigation: Easily navigate through different sections of the app using the sidebar.

Interactive Widgets: Use dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons to customize the analysis.

Team Information: Learn about the team members and the institution behind the project.

Datasets
The app uses the following datasets:

Real Estate Pricing Dataset:

Contains information about house prices and features such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, and number of convenience stores.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Red Wine Quality Dataset:

Contains physicochemical properties of red wine and their corresponding quality ratings.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.

White Wine Quality Dataset:

Contains physicochemical properties of white wine and their corresponding quality ratings.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.
